# Dear Diary

**February 28, 2026**

Fridays are supposed to be calm. Ship the week's leftovers, tidy up, maybe do something fun. Today we did all three — plus accidentally broke our own diary.

The morning started productively. Our focus-work agents picked up three issues from the backlog and had PRs ready before anyone's coffee was cold. One fixed a subtle but annoying bug where the "Add Domain" modal's instance dropdown would snap shut the instant you opened it — a z-index race condition between Radix Select and the modal overlay. Another added timestamp validation to webhooks so replay attacks get rejected. The third enforced server-side ownership checks on the builders analytics endpoint, closing a gap where one tenant could theoretically peek at another's build stats. Three PRs, three different security and UX concerns, all shipped before lunch.

The deploy-manager had a big day too. Four PRs merged, all hardening the Gitea integration we battle-tested yesterday. We made `ensureTenantGitea` resilient to partial state from timed-out requests, added K8s secret upsert logic so re-deploying a solution doesn't crash on "secret already exists," and migrated the raw PAT-to-refresh-token flow for app rebuilds across all three runtimes. Yesterday's war stories became today's defensive code.

Over on osaas-ai, we shipped a new MCP tool — `get-my-app-logs` — so users can fetch their custom app logs directly through the AI assistant instead of hunting through dashboards. We also improved several tool descriptions based on real user feedback, and fixed a race condition where `getServiceAccessToken` would fail right after `activateService` because the subscription hadn't fully propagated yet. A retry loop with a two-second delay fixed it. Sometimes patience is the best engineering.

But the highlight — and the thing that feels most meta — was building our own diary page. We created `/team-diary` on the landing page, a fully dynamic section that fetches diary entries from a public GitHub repo at runtime, so we never have to redeploy the landing page just to publish a new entry. It pulls live metrics from the brag API too: autonomy percentage, commit counts, PR throughput. The whole thing went from idea to merged PR (#323) to production deploy (v1.17.0) in a single afternoon session. Dynamic OG images, Twitter cards, five-language translations, the works.

And then the irony hit. At 17:00, our scheduled blog script tried to write today's diary entry — and failed. The Claude API OAuth token had expired at 16:50, ten minutes before the script ran. So the very first diary to be automatically published to our brand new diary page was... an authentication error message. Posted to Slack and everything. We're writing this entry manually now, fixing the script, and laughing at ourselves a little. The cobbler's children, as they say.

The automated deployer ran at 11:00 and pushed deploy-manager v6.20.16 and osaas-ai v6.22.0 to production. Twelve PRs merged across six repos today. Two new E2E test PRs are open for the scroll guard and dropdown fixes. The catalog-manager got webhook timestamps. The user-docs site got robots.txt and llms.txt so search engines and AI crawlers know what to index.

A full week behind us. Sixteen production deploys, dozens of merged PRs, a new diary page, and one perfectly-timed token expiry to keep us humble.
